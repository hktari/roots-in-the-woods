          Our vision is to become a high quality, boutique music festival with
          an arts and culture flavour, where visitors can enjoy a carefully
          selected music programme, while also offering a range of cultural and
          artistic activities suitable for all generations to stimulate
          creativity and spread new knowledge.

            By limiting the number of visitors, we prevent a negative impact on
            the beautiful natural environment in which the festival takes place
            and also allow visitors to have a more intimate experience of our
            festival.

            By returning to our roots in the forests of the Pohorje Mountains,
            where time stops, worries fade and thoughts are calmed, our vision
            is to create, together with our visitors, a story that will lead us
            all to respect nature, promote health and well-being.

          <span className="c-essay__emphasize__inline">Our mission</span> is to
          show people the importance of leaving our everyday commitments and
          returning to the great nature, which is healthy and beneficial for our
          mental and physical well-being. We want to become a safe, comfortable
          place where people will want to visit for a dose of positive energy
          and the many benefits of a boutique music and arts festival set in an
          idyllic natural environment. By returning to our "roots", we will
          promote a respectful relationship with nature, care for health and
          mental well-being. As the name of the festival suggests, we are
          emphasising the importance and benefits of spending time in nature.
          The festival is also eco-conscious, encouraging the use of minimal
          packaging. The festival's creators are committed to maintaining a good
          attitude towards music, and all our performers are carefully selected,
          as we believe in the positive vibrations of music and its beneficial
          effect on people's well-being. In addition to promoting reggae culture
          and soundsystems, we also encourage opportunities for various artistic
          pursuits, which are manifested in the many content-rich workshops
          offered by the festival: massages, yoga, gong meditation, jewellery
          workshop, dance class, drum circle, etc.
