          Our vision is to become a high quality, boutique music festival with
          an arts and culture flavour, where visitors can enjoy a carefully
          selected music programme, while also offering a range of cultural and
          artistic activities suitable for all generations to stimulate
          creativity and spread new knowledge.

            By limiting the number of visitors, we prevent a negative impact on
            the beautiful natural environment in which the festival takes place
            and also allow visitors to have a more intimate experience of our
            festival.

            By returning to our roots in the forests of the Pohorje Mountains,
            where time stops, worries fade and thoughts are calmed, our vision
            is to create, together with our visitors, a story that will lead us
            all to respect nature, promote health and well-being.

          As the name of the festival suggests, we are emphasising the
          importance and benefits of spending time in nature. The festival is
          also eco-conscious, encouraging the use of minimal packaging.

          In addition to promoting reggae culture and soundsystems, we also
          encourage opportunities for various artistic pursuits, which are
          manifested in the many content-rich workshops offered by the festival:
          massages, yoga, gong meditation, jewellery workshop, dance class, drum
          circle, etc.
